# Valuing Stocks Using EPS Part 2
In the first article, we discussed how to calculate stock’s current stock price. For review, you can compute the stock price by multiplying a company’s **trailing twelve months (TTM)** earnings by its **pe-ratio.** This is a very straight forward process, but it does have a few caveats that we will discuss in this article.

### PE-Ratio
As we discussed in the previous article, the **pe-ratio tells us how much we are willing to pay for each dollar of a company’s earnings.** How do we determine the pe-ratio for a company? Luckily, a company’s pe-ratio is publically available, and it can be found on almost any financial website that shows a company’s stock price. Several examples include: nyse.com, nasdaq.com, finance.yahoo.com and google.com/finance.

PE-Ratios can be used to compare companies, but more importantly, it can be used to measure the market’s sensitivity to changes in a company’s earnings. What does that mean exactly? Well, companies that are considered high growth companies, such as start ups or technology companies, tend to have a higher pe-ratio. This is because people expect to make a higher return for investing in a riskier company. Let’s take a look at three different companies: Amazon, Apple Home Depot.
> ##### Sample PE-Ratios
>|Amazon (AMZN) | Apple (AAPL) | Home Depot (HD) |
>|                       ---:|                   ---:|                           ---:|
>| 82                       |  19                 |  17                          |
As a point of reference, the S&P 500 has a historical pe-ratio of 16. Notice in the table above how much greater Amazon’s ratio is than Apple and Home Depot. This is due to several factors. The obvious one is that Amazon is considered a technology, and as we said earlier, technology companies historically tend to have a higher ratio. Apple could be considered a technology, but most professional analysts consider it a consumer goods company. Two other key factors differentiate it from Amazon. First, Amazon is a much younger company than either Apple or Home Depot, and its AWS product is still considered early in its growth cycle. Second, both Apple and Home Depot pay their shareholders a dividend.

### Which PE-Ratio do we use?
